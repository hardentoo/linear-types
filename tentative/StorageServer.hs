-- Remark on efficiency: (1) frees stuff from the heap and (2)
-- allocates the same amount. We can reasonably expect that an
-- optimizer will reuse the space instead of performing two inverse heap
-- manipulations.


-- In a production code, the server state will inevitably contain
-- references to (linear) contexts for database, disk, etc. See
-- "HaskellR.hs" for how such contexts are meant to be managed.

-- | Here we give an example of server combinators: we try to fetch
-- data from the first server, but if that fails we go for the second one.
-- We store always in both servers.
