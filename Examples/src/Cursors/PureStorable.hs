-- Cursor Types:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- | A "needs" cursor requires a list of fields be written to the
-- bytestream before the data is fully initialized.  Once it is, a
-- value of the (second) type parameter can be extracted.
newtype Needs (l :: [*]) t = Needs (Seq ByteString)

-- | A "has" cursor is a pointer to a series of consecutive,
-- serialized values.  It can be read multiple times.
newtype Has (l :: [*]) = Has (Seq ByteString)
  deriving Show

-- | A packed value is very like a singleton Has cursor.  It
-- represents a dense encoding of a single value of the type `a`.
newtype Packed a = Packed ByteString
  deriving (Show,Eq)


-- Cursor interface

-- the value written, because that value is serialized and copied.
